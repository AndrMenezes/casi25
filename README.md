## Finite mixture representations of zero-&-N-inflated distributions for count-compositional data

> In this talk, we provide novel probabilistic characterisations of two multivariate distributions designed to handle zero-inflation in count-compositional data. Such models are increasingly relevant in areas such as pollen counts and human microbiome studies, where counts exhibit an excess of zeros.
We propose a unifying framework that represents both distributions as parsimonious finite mixture models and discuss key statistical properties and stochastic representations for each. In particular, we derive marginal distributions and moments, and show that both models can also accommodate positive dependence and overdispersion.
In the i.i.d. setting, we develop Bayesian inference schemes with efficient Gibbs sampling updates. Simulation studies are presented to highlight the advantages of accounting for zero-inflation in modelling.
Finally, we extend this framework to incorporate covariates using a non-parametric regression approach. This extension is demonstrated through an application to modern climate-pollen interactions, contributing to ongoing efforts in the paleoclimate research community.
